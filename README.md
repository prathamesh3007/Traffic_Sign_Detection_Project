# Traffic-Sign-Detection-Project (semester-05)
Proper management of traffic-sign inventory is an essential task to ensure safety and
efficiency in the flow of traffic. It is mainly done in manual mode. Traffic signs are
captured using a vehicle-mounted camera, and manual localization and recognition
occur off-line by the human operator for consistency with the already-existing database.
Such manual work can be very time-consuming when applied to thousands of kilometers
of roads. Automating this task would significantly reduce the amount of physical work
and improve safety by detecting damaged or missing traffic signs much more quickly. A
comprehensive way towards the automation of this task is a replacement of the manual
localization and recognition of traffic signs with an automatic detection. The problem of
traffic-sign recognition already gained substantial attention in the computer-vision
community and excellent detection and recognition algorithms have already been
proposed. But these solutions have has been designed for only a few types, mainly for
traffic signs relates to advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) as well as
autonomous cars. Detection and identification of a large set of categories of traffic signs
are left open. Numerous earlier benchmarks approached the traffic-sign recognition and
detection problem. However, a majority of them addressed only TSR and disregarded
the much more challenging task of traffic-sign detection (TSD) where the correct
location of the traffic sign is to be identified. In existing technology, color information
enhancement or shape information enhancement methods are usually used as the
preprocess stage of traffic sign detection.
